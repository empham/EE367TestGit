In green Manoa Valley our Alma Mater stands
Where mountain winds and showers refresh her fertile lands;
The flag of freedom beckons above her shining halls,
To larger truth and service our Alma Mater calls.
As sons and daughters claiming her freely offered stores;
Our loyal priase we tender, and pledge to hold thy aim,
Till ocean's far horizons shall hear thy honored name.
